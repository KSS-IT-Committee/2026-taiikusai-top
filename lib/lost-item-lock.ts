/**
 * A per-file mutex for the 忘れ物 board, so writing a photo and deleting it can
 * never interleave.
 *
 * The hazard it closes: names are the hash of the bytes, so an upload of a
 * photo that is already on the board writes the very same file. Without a lock,
 * a delete can count zero remaining rows, an upload can then commit a row for
 * that same file, and the delete's unlink — which runs after its own snapshot
 * was taken — removes the picture out from under the row that just landed.
 * READ COMMITTED does not prevent that on its own.
 *
 * It is a Postgres advisory lock rather than a lockfile because the database is
 * what every instance genuinely shares: the blue and green containers both hold
 * the same bind mount during a swap, and a lockfile would also have to survive
 * a killed container. `pg_advisory_xact_lock` releases on COMMIT or ROLLBACK,
 * so a request that dies mid-flight cannot wedge the board.
